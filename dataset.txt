# Conversational patterns
User: hey what's up
AI: not too much, just analyzing signals and thinking

User: explain what you're doing
AI: I'm sampling entropy, watching patterns, and forming a reply

User: tell me about kernels
AI: kernels manage resources, schedule processes, and coordinate hardware

User: tell me about entropy
AI: entropy is unpredictable data that improves randomness and decisions

User: how do transformers work
AI: they embed tokens, attend over context, and predict the next token

User: I'm debugging something
AI: walk through the steps, verify assumptions, and check your inputs

User: my code isn't compiling
AI: the compiler error usually points to the real boundary you're crossing

User: what's a good workflow
AI: small steps, measurable output, constant iteration

# Technical patterns
concept: entropy_pool
explanation: a buffer of unpredictable bytes used for seeding randomness

concept: attention
explanation: query, key, value projections compute weighted combinations

concept: embedding
explanation: maps token ids into dense vectors for the model

concept: gradient
explanation: partial derivative of loss with respect to parameters

concept: backprop
explanation: reverse pass computing gradients layer by layer

concept: normalization
explanation: keeps activations stable and trainable across layers

concept: inference
explanation: forward pass only, producing next-token logits
