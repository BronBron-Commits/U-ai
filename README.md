# U-ai
A tiny Rust-based AI experiment designed to run entirely inside Termux.  
Includes:
• Entropy-powered RNG  
• Basic tokenizer  
• Simple transition-table “toy” model  
• Training loop  
• Interactive chat mode  
• Fully offline, no dependencies on external APIs

## Requirements
• Termux with Rust installed  
• bincode crate (included in Cargo.toml)  
• A dataset file: dataset.txt  
• A saved model file: toy_model.tmod (generated by --train)

## Commands

### Train the toy model
Reads dataset.txt, builds a simple transition table, saves toy_model.tmod.
